Gini Android Vision documentation
=================================

Introduction
------------

Gini provides an information extraction system for analyzing documents (e. g. invoices or
contracts), specifically information such as the document sender or the amount to pay in an invoice.

The Gini Vision for Android library provides functionality to capture documents with mobile phones.
The captured images are automatically enhanced on the device and optimized so they provide both the
best results when used with the Gini API and an optimized user experience.
